# TODO
- [ ] Turn water purple, maybe?
- [ ] Ice mountains; dark green sky, greyish-white foliage (to represent snow). Extremely tall. Covered in ice spikes. Strays completely replace regular skeletons.
- [ ] Twilight Oceans: SUPER deep. The bottoms are warm (sand bottom, seagrass, kelp, tropical fish, Axolotls, maybe even coral), but the surface is frozen over with icebergs.
- [ ] Ender Mountains: Add obsidian pillars. See if a structure processor can replace random blocks with crying obsidian.
- [ ] Drought Forest: A taiga forest with trees that reach to the sky, but going through a drought. Ground is replaced with sand, foliage colors are dry and dead, dead bushes are the only small shrubbery.

# Notes
- In noise settings, bedrock\_roof\_position is an offset from the TOP, while bedrock\_floor\_position is an offset from the BOTTOM. To get rid of one or the other, just set it to an obscene out-of-bounds number; that's what vanilla seems to do.
